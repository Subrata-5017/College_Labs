    <h1>What is Ruby?</h1>
    <p>Have you been thinking of learning a new programming language, but aren't sure which one?<br><br>

        If you've done much research or had any experience in computer programming, chances are you've seen Ruby
        programming discussed. Ruby is a highly popular programming language that's used for lots of things, from
        web app development to data analysis. It's also very user-friendly compared to other programming languages,
        and it's fairly easy to learn if you'r willing to put in the work <br> <br>

        Perhaps best of all, Ruby programming skills are highly in-demand in the marketplace, and being able to code
        using Ruby can make you a very versatile and useful programmer. <br><br>

        But if this is the first time you're hearing about Ruby, you may be feeling a little overwhelmed. After all,
        there's a wealth of information on programming on the internet, but not all of it is helpful. Where should
        you begin if you're just a beginner trying to learn Ruby?<br><br>

        While there are lots of resources on the web for mastering Ruby programming, this article will give you a
        solid introduction. Keep reading to find out what Ruby is and what it's for.</p>
    <img src="../images/ruby.jpg">
     <h1>How Ruby Works</h1>
    <p>Ruby is a highly flexible programming language. Developers coding in Ruby can make changes to the way the
        language itself works. It's an interpreted language like Python, rather than a compiled one like C or C++.
        <br> <br>

        But unlike Python, which focuses on a single, unambiguous solution for every problem, Ruby projects try to
        take multiple different approaches to problem-solving. As you might have guessed, there are benefits and
        disadvantages to both methods, depending on your project. <br><br>

        One feature that makes Ruby so user-friendly is that it hides a lot of details from the programmer. This
        makes programming with Ruby much easier than using other mainstream languages with more complexity, such as
        C and C++. However, it also means that finding bugs in the code can be more difficult. <br><br>

        Conveniently, code you write in Ruby will run on any of the major operating systems without having to be
        ported, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    </p>
    <h1>Benefits of Ruby</h1>
    <P>You don't have to spend much time researching computing programming before you come across mentions of Ruby
        on Rails or the Ruby programming language. But what exactly is it? <br><br>

        According to the official Ruby project website, the Ruby language is one of careful balance between
        functional programming and imperative programming. It was designed to be natural and intuitive, but not too
        simple to be effective. Fans of Ruby consider it "a beautiful, artful language". <br> <br>

        More specifically, Ruby is a scripting language designed for front- and back-end web development, as well as
        other similar applications. It's a robust, dynamically typed, object-oriented language, with high-level
        syntax that makes programming with it feel almost like coding in English. In fact, some people feel that
        they can practically understand Ruby code before even learning how to program. <br> <br>

        Ruby on Rails, Ruby's web framework, is one of the most popular web development frameworks in any language.
        Although Ruby is probably most famous for its use in web development, it has many other uses, too. Some of
        these include automation, command-line tools, static site generation, DevOps, web scraping, and data
        processing. <br><br>

        Perhaps most importantly, Ruby is a highly versatile and portable language. It can be used just as easily on
        Windows, macOS, Linux, and even UNIX and DOS. No matter what programming job you want to get done, there's a
        gold chance you can do it in Ruby.</P><br>
