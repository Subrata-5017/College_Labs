    <h1>C Programming Basics Explained</h1>
    <p>C language is one of the oldest and most powerful programming languages widely used across the world. It combines
        the elements of high-level languages with the functionality of assembly language and is often called a
        middle-level computer language. Due to its portability, clean style, and closeness to the hardware, it is ideal
        for the low-level development of operating system kernels and embedded software. C language is considered as the
        base for many other programming languages and is known as the mother language.</p>

    <h1>What is C Programming Language?</h1>
    <p>C programming is a general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell
        Labs. It is a low-level language commonly used for system programming, such as operating systems, device
        drivers, embedded systems, and other applications requiring high performance and efficient memory management.
    </p>
    <p>C programming is a structured programming language organized around functions and modules and supports features
        such as loops, conditionals, and pointers. It is also a compiled language, which means that programs written in
        C are translated into machine language by a compiler before being executed.
    </p>
    <p>
        C was developed to overcome the challenges experienced with BASIC, B, and BPCL programming languages. Many other
        languages, such as Java, PHP, and JavaScript have borrowed syntax and features directly or indirectly from the C
        programming language. C Programming is still widely used in various applications. It is a popular language for
        developing software for microcontrollers, which are small embedded systems that control various devices. It is
        also commonly used for game development, scientific computing, and other applications that require high
        performance and efficient memory usage.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages of C Language </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple :</b>C is a simple language as it offers a structured approach to solve problems. It also has a
            rich set of library functions and data types. C is usually taught as an introductory programming language as
            it is a well-established fact that it becomes easier to learn any other programming language if a person
            already knows the C language.</li><br>
        <li><b>Portable :</b> C programs can be written on one platform and can be executed in the same way on another
            operating system. C is a machine-independent language.</li><br>
        <li><b>Structured programming language :</b>C provides different functions that enable us to break the code into
            small parts, that is why C programs are easy to understand and modify. Functions also offer code
            reusability.</li><br>
        <li><b>Fast and Efficient:</b>Other programming languages, such as Python and Java offer more features than C
            language but their performance rate gets down due to additional processing. C programming language provides
            programmers access to direct manipulation with the computer hardware. The compilation and execution time of
            the C language is also fast.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Extensible:</b>C programming can easily adopt new features.</li><br>
        <li><b>Helps understand the fundamentals of Computer Theories: </b>Many computer theories like operating
            systems, computer networks, compiler designing, and computer architecture are based on the C programming
            language and need a good knowledge of C programming to work on them.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>Basic Structure of C Programming</h3>
    <pre>

        #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 
            int main() 
            {
            
              // printf() displays the content inside the double quotes
            
                
                printf("Hello, World! \n");
            
             
                return 0;
            
             
            }
